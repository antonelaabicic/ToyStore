## ðŸ“Œ About The Project

ToyStore is a web application that demonstrates the core functionality of a simple e-commerce platform. It provides a realistic shopping experience where users can explore different product categories, build a cart, and complete purchases through multiple payment options ie. cash on delivery or PayPal.

The application supports two types of users: anonymous and authenticated. Anonymous users can freely explore products and their categories while adding or removing items from a cart. If they actually want to complete the purchase, they need to sign in. Authenticated users include customers and administrators. Customers can finalize orders and access their own personal order history, while administrators manage the product catalog, monitor login activity, and review purchase records across users.

This project emphasizes secure access control, responsive design, and a smooth UX, showcasing modern web practices such as filters, listeners, and AJAX.
